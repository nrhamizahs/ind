		     <h3>MY BEAUTIFUL FAMILY</h3>
			 <p class="role">POTRAITS OF HOLIDAY</p>
			 <p>I spent most of my childhood with my parents. According to my personal background, I consist of 7 family members, including me, and I am the
			 fourthd child of five siblings. My siblings are 2 girls and 3 boys. We live in Pengkalan Chepa, Kelantan. My father worked as a prison officer. He was
			 the one who took care of us while my mother was a full-time housewife and she was a kind person. Both my brother works in Klang and my eldest
			 sister is working at Putrajaya, while I am a full-time student
			 majoring in a bachelor's degree in marketing business administration at UlTM. My younger brother is an SPM student. I am grateful to be born into a happy and harmonious family.</p>
