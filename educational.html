       <h1>MY EDUCATION BACKGROUND</h1>
     <img src="im1.jpeg" alt=""id="img1">
     <p>SMA TENGKU AMALIN AISYAH PUTRI</p>
     <p>In this school I studied for 5 years from 2013 to 2017 and achieved my satisfactory SPM results.  this school is a school for female students only, so it is a very comfortable school for me because i can make a lot of friends.  I also really like the teachers there because everything is very good.</p>

     <p>UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY OF MARA (UITM) MACHANG BRANCH</p>
     <p>I continued my studies at UiTM Machang campus majoring in accounting for 2 and a half years.  here for the first time I was away from family.  this was a very meaningful experience for me because of the different atmosphere and I was exposed to various activities.  for the first time I was active by attending many events such as archery clubs, cultural clubs and co -curriculum.  and I am also very happy because I have so many new friends.</p>
